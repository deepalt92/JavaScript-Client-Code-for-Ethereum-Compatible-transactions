1) "new.log" and "private-keys.log" contains the Ethereum wallet addresses and private keys generated using the Ethereumjs library: ethereumjs-wallet (see https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-wallet)
2) All generation_.js files create pre-signed transactions from the wallet addresses in "new.log" and private keys in "private-keys.log" that deploy and invoke functions in smart contracts. We used the: ethereumjs-tx library to create pre-signed transactions. Creating pre-signed transactions allows the reliable evaluation of blockchains as the time to sign a transaction is disregarded.
3) We need to ensure the accounts in the genesis block matches the pre-signed transaction's "from" address, for the transactions to be committed. Therefore, we create a custom genesis.json with the sole Python file in this repository.
